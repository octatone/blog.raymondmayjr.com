I am a front end engineer working and enjoying life in Berlin.

Whether it manifests in the browser, on the server, in a CLI, or in embedded systems, I take Javascript very seriously; every JS devloper should have benchmark js in their tool belt.

Experimenting with build tools, frameworks, and new ECMA pipeline features are how I spend my free time.  Web audio, synthesis, canvas, and other multimedia are all areas I enjoy exploring.
